# Generic Style Guidelines

The goal behind most of the guidelines is to keep code simple and readable. This makes collaborating on projects easier and causes less issues down the road.

Please use these examples below as a starting point for the style guidelines of any club projects.

At the bottom are links to good examples and ideas about coding. They aren't rules by any means, but they may prove insightful to you.

## Simple Example

```c++
// Description of why your code does what it does
public void myFunction(int arg)
{
	int testVariable = 1;

	if (arg != 0)
	{
		MyClass sampleClass = new MyClass(arg);
	}
}
```

## Style Outline

- Comments
    - Used to describe why your code does what it does. Use proper grammar.
    - Place above the relevant lines of code
	- Comment classes, functions, and methods
	- Comment related blocks of code
	- Keep comments updated
- Line Length
    - 100 character limit
- Indention
    - Always indent for new scope
    - Indents are tabs
    - When you exceeded the line limit, create a new line and indent twice to signify continuation.
	- When breaking up a line return after commas, and before (+, -, ==, &&, etc).

```c++
if (bar == 5 || bar == 12 || bar == 98
		|| bar == 120 || bar == 177 || var == 180)
{
	foo = 2;
}
```
- Number of lines per file
    - Try to have a maximum of around 200 lines
- Spacing
	- Separate different tasks/ideas with a blank line
	- Separate different functions/classes/methods with a blank line
	- Use spaces around math operators and Boolean expressions

```c++
// Addition
int x = 1 + 3;

// Multiplication
bool y = true || false;
```
- Naming
	- Use descriptive names, with correctly spelled words
	- Constants in CAPS_WITH_UNDER
	- Classes in CapWords
	- Variables and methods in mixedCase
- Braces
	- Shall be placed on a new line

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
{
	std::cout << i;
}
```
- Other
	- Group related code
	- Avoid deep nesting


## Extended Example

```c++
/**
 * "Foo bar" program, provides a useful example for the
 * OSC coding guidelines.
 */

#include <iostream>

// Example class
class FooBar
{
	public int bar;

	FooBar(int foo, int bar)
	{
		this.bar = foo + bar;
	}
}

// Creates a foo from bar to add back to bar
private int makeFoo(int bar)
{
	// Normally foobar is twice bar
	int foo = bar;

	// Foobar can't be 0, because of arbitrary
	// reason for an example
	if (bar == 0)
	{
		foo = 1;
	}

	return foo;
}

// Adds foo and bar together
int main()
{
	int bar = 1;

	// Foo is derived from bar
	int foo = makeFoo(bar);

	FooBar fooBar = new FooBar(foo, bar);

	std::cout << fooBar.bar << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```
