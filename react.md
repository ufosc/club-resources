# React 

React is a web framework for user interfaces. It is relatively light for a [JavaScript](javascript.md) framework. It creates components (building blocks) for each UI element. This way you can reuse elements. It uses jsx (or tsx with TypeScript) files to defined the HTML layout in Javascript. 

It follows a waterfall model, where information flows from the top down. This can help to make better designed and less complex projects.
