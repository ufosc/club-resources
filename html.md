# HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the web. It describes and defines the content of a webpage. That does **not** include the appearance ([CSS](css.md)) or functionality ([JavaScript](javascript.md)) of a webpage.

"HyperText" refers to links that connect webpages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<img>`, and many others.
