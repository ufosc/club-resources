# Rust

Rust is a systems level programming language with an emphasis on performance, reliability, productivity, and readability. It has the low level performance of C or C++ without the danger of having pointer problems. It is able to do this, because it's compiler ensures any potential errors aren't added (you can think of it as having a garbage collector at the compile stage).

Rust can be used for serer side software, embedded devices, websites (via WebAssembly), and much more as the community continues to grow. The official documentation (listed below) does an excellent job at introducing someone familiar with programming to Rust.

## Syntax

You can find the club's suggested style for Rust in the [style.md](style.md) file.
