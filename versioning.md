# Versioning 

Versioning is how projects describe differentiate between different versions of their software. Typically this is done via a number designation such as 1.2.6. The Open Source Club follow **Semantic Versioning** guidelines. This boils down to each number meaning MajorChange.MinorChange.Patch. 

**Major Change** - occurs when the API for the software breaks. This means that some or all of the software written to work with the project will no longer function correctly. 

**Minor Change** - happens when some functionality is added, but remained backwards compatible. This will the more normal reason for a version change. 

**Patch** - this is applied to fix any bugs or errors that occur. This will not add any features, just make the system more stable. 

Also of note, any Major Change number below 1 indicates the project is not ready for production use. While a Major Change of 1 and above indicates that the code should have a stable release to use.
