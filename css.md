# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in [HTML](html.md). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

It applies style based on classes, IDs, and relationships defined in HTML. CSS can change color, positioning, animations, size, and much more of any HTML element
