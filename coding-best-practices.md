# Best Practices

1. **Don't be clever** - Though you could cram a lot of logic into one line or use esoteric syntax, it only makes the code less readable and more likely to be buggy.

2. **Don't pre-optimize** - Find out what actually needs to be optimized before using up your time doing it. Focus on getting the code working. 

3. **Comment well, and comment often** - Comments should help anyone with a basic knowledge of programming understand the why behind your code. The means that anyone in the future can work on it.

4. **Write code that does one thing well** - When code is written in small modules, it is much simpler to test, write, and collaboratively work on.  

5. **Keep it Simple Stupid** - Don't complicate things needlessly. The simple solution is often the best.
