# Bash 

Bash is the most common shell for Unix and Unix like (such as Linux) platforms. It allows a user to "talk" to a computer with a command line (as opposed to the normal GUI) and can be very powerful for scripting tasks.

It takes advantage of many small utilities (like `grep`, `curl`, or `find`) that each perform a specific task. You can navigate your files, download a video, or delete your entire operating system (ProTip: don't try that last one)! In many cases, you can chain together the output of one utility to be the input of another. This can be very powerful.

In addition to using the terminal, you can write bash scripts. They are similar to programs you make in other programming languages. It can ve very useful for automating repetitive task.
