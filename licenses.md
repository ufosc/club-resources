# Open Source Licenses 

Licenses are how we tell other people how to treat our code. Usually you'll have a license file in your project so it stays with your code. There are a couple of broad categories of open source licenses. 

**Permissive** licenses are less restrictive. In general, they don't require anyone using your code to make their project open source. However, they usually have to keep your license with your code. The **MIT** License is a very simple and popular permissive license. 

**Copyleft** licenses require any project using your code to also be open source. **GPLv3** is a good example of this. 

Other popular licenses are **Apache**, which grants patent rights to users, and **BSD 3-Clause**, which prevents people from using your/your organization's name to endorse their project. Keep in mind if you don't list a license, then the code is considered copyrighted by you, and others can't use it. 

The best way to choose a license, is to think about what your worried about (such as your code being used for proprietary project), and choose a license that protects against that.
